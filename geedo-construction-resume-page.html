               <p class="geedo-p">Before I became a developer I worked in the customer experience industry for 4 years. And Prior to going into the customer experience industry, I studied Computers and Electronics Engineering Technology, this is the point where i first gained an understanding of computer sciences, and realized i wanted to secretly control machines.<br><br> With that fantasy tucked deep somewhere in the back of my mind, I picked up a job, working for 2 years as an electronic assembler for an oil exploration company in Sugarland, Tx.<br><br> Then i began as an electronics technician for 2 years in the oil exploration industry, troubleshooting, and repairing downhole electro-mechanical tools. After two years of repetition, my ambitions began to expand, as well as the determination to live a better, and more comfortable lifestyle, I worked in instrumentation for an oil, gas, and military aircraft parts distribution giant for 3 years in Houston, Tx.<br><br> I lived in San Antonio building my knowledge of the costumer experience industry, and operating my own essential hygiene and rugs retail businesses before moving back, closer to the Houston area. Once i touched back down in Houston, and i was still clinging on to life with my businesses, I finally decided to give my secret programming fantasy a shot, and i signed up with CodeCademy.<br><br> I am still a student there, taking the Full Stack Engineering course as you read this, but that has not slowed me up, one bit! Every last one of my experiences have led up to what i am now.</p>

Courses like Computer Science, and Microprocessors, exposed me to a rabbit hole i would never leave. We learned and completed enough exercises in Binary, Boolean, and Network Security, that we began to build many projects in a team setting. After graduating with my associates of applied science, I knew one day i would come back to a form of engineering within the electronics and coding environment.</p>
